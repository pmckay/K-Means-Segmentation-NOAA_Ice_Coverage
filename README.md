# K-Means-Segmentation-NOAA_Ice_Coverage

###  YOLOv11 Ice Coverage K-Means Segmentation Model
 Importance of this model in a paragraph, including why I decided to use K-Means to complete this task, the image amounts, 
 
 To improve the model, talk about the augmentations and why the cluster amounts were chosen
 
 Add a whole bunch of information about the model, the statistics I have yet to do, the overall trend detected with this dataset.
